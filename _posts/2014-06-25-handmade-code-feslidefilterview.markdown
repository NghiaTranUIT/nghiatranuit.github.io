# Fe Slide Filter View

Hi everybody as an iOS developer like me ;]

I have just released my customize control in GitHub.

[su_button url=”https://github.com/NghiaTranUIT/FeSlideFilter” target=”blank” style=”flat” size=”6″ icon=”icon: github”]Github[/su_button]

Here video as sample :

# Technical

FeSlideFilter was build on top UIView. I combine UIScrollView with paging for title filter, and Mask layer technique. Here is what’s going on:

- Subclass UIView
- Using UIScrollView with paging for title filter
- Using LUT filter technique for apply effect to photo
- Conform UIScrollViewDelegate for interactive control – slide filter by your touch.
- Using Layer’s mask technique for implementing two-side previewer.
- Provide own delegate and datasource.
