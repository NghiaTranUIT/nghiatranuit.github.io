Hi everyone, this is long time i haven’t written any post in my blog. So i decide i need to PR my awesome open source which i implemented it few months ago.

Almost of them are inspired by [Tim Holman’s collection](http://codepen.io/collection/HtAne/ "Tim Holman's collection") .

# Github

I publish this project in github : [https://github.com/NghiaTranUIT/FeSpinner](https://github.com/NghiaTranUIT/FeSpinner "https://github.com/NghiaTranUIT/FeSpinner")

And it’s under MIT license, so feel free to reuse it ;]


# How to use

If you are fresher or senior iOS dev, i swear that you have hear [MBProgressHUD](https://github.com/jdg/MBProgressHUD "MBProgressHUD") one time at least.

All of loader in Rocket Loader Collection is so similar with MBProgressHUB. Just use few code line, and leave the rest to Rocket. It will be done for you ;]
