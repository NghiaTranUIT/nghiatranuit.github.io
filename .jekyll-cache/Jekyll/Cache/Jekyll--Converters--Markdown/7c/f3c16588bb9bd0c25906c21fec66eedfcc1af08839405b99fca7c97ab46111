<p>Hello my fellows,</p>

<p>Today I’m delighted to announce an astonishing hobby project which I’m working on in spare time 🔥</p>

<p>I admit I’m a lazy boy. To embrace to time-consume tasks or general obstacles, I usually find out the efficient way to accomplish it. I remembered the day I was in Hanoi, at Coffee House. After a long day hard working, I decided to go home.</p>

<p>I was struggled to get a Uber car. All of the things I need are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Grab a phone from my pocket.</li>
  <li>Find an app.</li>
  <li>Open Uber and waiting for initialization.</li>
  <li>Select the desired destination.</li>
  <li>Waiting … 😪</li>
  <li>Waiting …</li>
  <li>An Uber guy accepts my request.</li>
  <li>Waiting …</li>
  <li>Waiting for his call for pickup confirmation.</li>
  <li>Check his position frequency.</li>
  <li>Waiting for a miracle.</li>
  <li>Finally, after little time trying to open the phone, check, and close the app. I get into a car.</li>
</ol>

<p>It often drives me nuts 😪.</p>

<p>🚗 At the end of a trip, an unexpected idea pulled out from my head, I realized Uber APIs 🚀 had been published publicly since a year. I made a decision to port it to macOS flatform by myself.</p>

<p>And now, it’s almost done : &gt;</p>
