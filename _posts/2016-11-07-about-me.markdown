## Hackathon

- [Runner-up prize] at EdTech Hanoi 2016. We built a [VirtualBook](https://github.com/VirtualBook/VirtualBook). It’s an open platform where people can contribute/submit their knowledge as lectures/slides in supported 3D VR models and others can use them for educational purposes.
- [Fail] at Hack&Roll 2016 – 24 hours Hackathon base in NUS, Singapore. Got a scholarship for a free trip from Vietnam. Unfortunately, the first plan was failed (tried to build indoor-location GPS by 12 pieces of [Estimote](http://estimote.com) device). So I and Huy came up with [AwesomeButton](https://devpost.com/software/awesomebox). Inspired from “In case of fire … #Git #Commit”. We built from Photon + IFTTT + Raspberry pi + mobile. Things we can found at Hack&Roll’s warehouse. We aimed Useless-Stuff prize, but there is a team built a special pin which “more” useless than ours 😀
- [Fail] at HCMC Hackathon Vietnam 2014. We built an Online ticket booking service. The best things we built is integrated with Passbook in iOS. Allow people to check-in easier.
- [Third Prize] at Vietnam Mobile Hackathon 2013. Within 24h, we built StoMo, mean StopMotion. We implemented all things from scratch. Allow us to take a bunch of photos, compose it and render high-quality video. Interestingly enough, we use StoMo to make a short video at the last hour of Hackathon 😀
- [Second Prize] at Mobile Got Talent – VTC Academy 2012. It’s the first time I attended a competition. I built ILoveQuote with clean design, hundred inspiration quote, and beautiful background.


## Things I’ve talked about iOS and Swift:

- [iOS-Awesome-Kickstarter-Kit](https://github.com/NghiaTranUIT/iOS-Awesome-Starter-Kit): A presentation to share how the startup can ship the first prototype quickly. Built on by strong base-foundation by perfect combination: CleanSwift + PromiseKit + ReSwift. Easily to change, extend, improve the features. I also mention a real problem with MVC and common mistakes when building a project.
- Build iOS for 24-hours: TekTalk extends to Hanoi city. I and my friend create small meet-up and help the people to build an iOS app. We cover from design and bring it to the real app step by step.
- iOS Best Practice: The first time I’ve been a speaker at TekTalk community. Take a look at best practice for iOS developer. It’s real problem I encounter when developing feels app. Make a benchmark for each problem: Such as Caching Manager, Pre-heating, Priority-Image download queue, IMGIX. Implemented basic “Source of truth” for State-management and combine with KVO
- Clean Swift Architecture at Hanoi: A short talk to demonstrate advantages about Clean Swift Architecture under start-up environment.
- Diff Algorithm & Practice Vietnam Swift 2017: Discuss LCS, Diff and applying on UITableView/UICollectionView
